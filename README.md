On any given day, many professionals who are interested in the courses land on their website and browse for courses.Now, although X Education gets a lot of leads(potential customers), its lead conversion rate is very poor.
The company(X Education) requires you to build a model wherein you need to assign a lead score to each of the leads such that the customers with a higher lead score have a higher conversion chance and the customers with a lower lead score have a lower conversion chance.
